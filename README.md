# Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN) Implementation

## About The Project

This project is a Python-based implementation of the Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) using PyTorch. SRGAN is a pivotal development in the field of computer vision, enabling the enhancement of image resolution beyond traditional methods. By leveraging adversarial networks, SRGAN attempts to reconstruct low-resolution images into high-definition outputs. This repository not only implements the core technology but also provides tools for training and testing the model with custom datasets.

### Built With

This section lists the major frameworks and libraries that you need to run the project:

- [Python](https://python.org/) - The programming language used.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The deep learning framework.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - For image manipulation operations.
- [NumPy](http://numpy.org/) - For high-performance scientific computing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iamFury2K/SR-GAN_Scratch.git
   cd SR-GAN_Scratch
   ```

2. **Install required Python libraries**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Here's how you can use this project to upscale images:

1. **Prepare your dataset**

   Place your low-resolution images in a folder named `data/input`.

2. **Train the model**

   To train the model on your dataset, run:

   ```sh
   python train.py 
   ```

   Adjust the parameters as necessary.
